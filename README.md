# Auto Pascal Files - A VScode extension

This is the README for your extension **"auto-pascal-files"**. This extension automatically renames newly created files to PascalCase, improving file organization and readability.

## Features

- **Automatic Renaming**: Automatically renames any new file created in your project to PascalCase (e.g., `my file.txt` becomes `MyFile.txt`).
- **Toggle Functionality**: Easily enable or disable the automatic renaming feature using  `pascaal` command.


> Tip: Consider creating a short animation demonstrating the feature in action for better user engagement.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code**: This extension requires VS Code version 1.50.0 or higher.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not currently add any specific settings to the VS Code configuration. The automatic renaming feature is toggled on or off through the command.

## Known Issues

- The extension may not correctly rename files if there are naming conflicts (e.g., a file with the new name already exists). Ensure that files are uniquely named before creation.
- The automatic renaming feature may not trigger if the file is created in rapid succession after the initial creation.
